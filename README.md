# RGB Sign
 RGB Wifi Sign Controller using ESP32

This is an RGB Sign I created for our church.  It is an Arduino based design using a custom PCB I created to conrol three separate RGB strings.  I created the PCB using a two-sided copper board and a laser burner, but someone could just as easily send it out for build.

The Arduino is setup to create a WIFI captive portal which is used to control the three strands.
